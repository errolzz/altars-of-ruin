Deep under the Sodden Mires lay the Blind Caverns. Here, somewhere in the twisting tunnels the revered hunter Vourin feels his way around a slick stone edge. He can hear the heavy breathing of several Milkeye ahead, and he knows they have picked up his scent.

The timeless beast Moonskin, a monster seen only once by a lone survivor of a mining expedition ages past dwells here. The brave and headstrong still hunt the beast, their remains add to the crunch of the bone-strewn walkways.

Vourin strikes in the dark like a sprung trap killing three Milkeye Lurkers and a Rager in an blink. As he pulls in a lung of air to steady himself the ground under his feet shifts slightly. Vourin notices for the first time he no longer stands of the wet stone of the caverns.

A mad thought sears through his mind and he fumbles to light the flare he was saving...


...Vourin's eyes adjust and he adjusts his grip on the steel claws he carries in terrible expectation. As the contours of the chamber come into focus, he stands not on solid ground but on the very spine of the legendary Moonskin! The terrible beast fills the chamber. Covered in crisp white scales, a mass of tails, legs, and claws. Unable to move, Vourin scans upward to find a pair of incandescent eye slits gazing down at him.

In that moment Vourin is resigned to death, but he scowls and assumes his finest attack pose all the same. Moonskin attacks like a boulder falling off a mountain. The force as the serpents body slams into the cavern wall causes rock to fall like rain. Vourin's famous reflexes saved him from instant death and he now scrambles towards the recovering form of Moonskin. 

He strikes with all his might, again and again, viciously tearing into the surprisingly supple body of the beast. But there is no blood, just more scales. Layers and layers of soft white armor, and Vourin turns to run...
